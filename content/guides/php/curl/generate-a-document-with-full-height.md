In this guide, we'll show you how to generate a document with full height dynamically using PHP and the cURL library to convert them to PDF using PDFShift's API.

When you're converting a document, you might want to generate a document with full height dynamically. This can be done by setting the `format` parameter to the request and passing it a custom "auto" value for the `{height}` part.


```php
# You can get an API key at https://pdfshift.io
$api_key = 'sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx'

$params = array (
    'source' => 'https://www.example.com',
    'format' => '1280xauto'
)

$curl = curl_init('https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf');
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($params));
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    'Authorization: Basic ' . base64_encode('api:' . $api_key)
));

$response = curl_exec($curl);
if ($response === false) {
    $error_message = curl_error($curl);
    curl_close($curl);
    throw new Exception("cURL error: $error_message");
}

// Get the HTTP status code
$http_status = curl_getinfo($curl, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);

// Close cURL resource
curl_close($curl);

// Check if the request was successful
if ($http_status !== 200) {
    throw new Exception("Request failed with HTTP status code: $http_status");
}

// Save the file to result.pdf
file_put_contents('result.pdf', $response);

echo 'The PDF document was generated and saved to result.pdf';
```

The format parameter can accept various values, such as 'Letter', 'Legal', 'Tabloid', 'Ledger', 'A0', 'A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4', 'A5'.

But it can also accept a custom values that is defined per the width and height as follow: `{width}x{height}`

Both `width` and `height` are pixel value by default, but if you precise the unit (in "cm", "mm", "in" or "pt"). That unit will be used instead.

For instance, you can set a format of:

```json
{
    "source": "https://www.example.com",
    "format": "21cmx29,7cm"
}
```

Now, if you want a "liquid" height, which will analyze the height of the page and use it as your format, you can set the `{height}` value to `auto`.
So, instead of setting a fixed height such as `'format': '1280x1024'`, you can set `'format': '1280xauto'` and the height will be calculated based on the content of the page.
