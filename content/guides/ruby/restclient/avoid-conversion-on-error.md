In this guide, we'll show you how to abort the conversion when loading the distant source does not return a 2XX response.

When you're converting a document, you might want to avoid the conversion on error when loading the document. This can be done by setting the `raise_for_status` parameter to `True` in the request.


```ruby
require 'rest-client'
require 'json'

# You can get an API key at https://pdfshift.io
api_key = 'sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx'

params = {
    'source' => 'https://www.httpstat.us/404',
    'raise_for_status' => True
}

# Make the POST request
response = RestClient.post("https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf", params.to_json, {
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
    'Authorization' => "Basic #{Base64.strict_encode64("api:#{api_key}")}"
})

# Check for successful response
unless response.code == 200
    raise "Request failed with status code #{response.code}: #{response.body}"
end

# write response to a file nammed "result.pdf"
File.open('result.pdf', 'wb') { |f| f.write(response.body) }

# Print a success message
puts 'The PDF document was generated and saved to result.pdf'
```

Passing `raise_for_status` to `true` will ensure that if PDFShift can not load your document, the conversion will fail with an error.
