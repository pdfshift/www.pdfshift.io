In this guide, we'll show you how to generate a document with full height dynamically using Ruby and the RestClient library to convert them to PDF using PDFShift's API.

When you're converting a document, you might want to generate a document with full height dynamically. This can be done by setting the `format` parameter to the request and passing it a custom "auto" value for the `{height}` part.


```ruby
require 'rest-client'
require 'json'

# You can get an API key at https://pdfshift.io
api_key = 'sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx'

params = {
    'source' => 'https://www.example.com',
    'format' => '1280xauto'
}

# Make the POST request
response = RestClient.post("https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf", params.to_json, {
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
    'X-API-Key' => api_key
})

# Check for successful response
unless response.code == 200
    raise "Request failed with status code #{response.code}: #{response.body}"
end

# write response to a file nammed "result.pdf"
File.open('result.pdf', 'wb') { |f| f.write(response.body) }

# Print a success message
puts 'The PDF document was generated and saved to result.pdf'
```

The format parameter can accept various values, such as 'Letter', 'Legal', 'Tabloid', 'Ledger', 'A0', 'A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4', 'A5'.

But it can also accept a custom values that is defined per the width and height as follow: `{width}x{height}`

Both `width` and `height` are pixel value by default, but if you precise the unit (in "cm", "mm", "in" or "pt"). That unit will be used instead.

For instance, you can set a format of:

```json
{
    "source": "https://www.example.com",
    "format": "21cmx29,7cm"
}
```

Now, if you want a "liquid" height, which will analyze the height of the page and use it as your format, you can set the `{height}` value to `auto`.
So, instead of setting a fixed height such as `'format': '1280x1024'`, you can set `'format': '1280xauto'` and the height will be calculated based on the content of the page.
