In this guide, we'll show you how to convert HTML documents to PDFs using PDFShift's API. This is a straightforward process that can be accomplished with just a few lines of Ruby code.

```ruby
require 'faraday'
require 'json'

# You can get an API key at https://pdfshift.io
api_key = 'sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx'

params = {
    'source' => 'https://www.example.com',
}

# Create a Faraday connection
conn = Faraday.new(url: "https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf") do |faraday|
    faraday.request :url_encoded
    faraday.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
end

# Make the POST request
response = conn.post do |req|
    req.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    req.headers['Authorization'] = "Basic #{Base64.strict_encode64("api:#{api_key}")}"
    req.body = params.to_json
end

# Check for successful response
unless response.success?
    raise "Request failed with status code #{response.status}: #{response.body}"
end

# write response to a file nammed "result.pdf"
File.open('result.pdf', 'wb') { |f| f.write(response.body) }

# Print a success message
puts 'The PDF document was generated and saved to result.pdf'
```
