In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of sending custom HTTP headers when requesting an URL to be converted to PDF using PDFShift's API.

This can be useful to pass custom parameters to your server. It can help for instance to identify from where is coming the request, and add some extra layer of security.

```ruby
require 'faraday'
require 'json'

# You can get an API key at https://pdfshift.io
api_key = 'sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx'

params = {
    'source' => 'https://www.example.com',
    'http_headers' => {
        'x-custom-header' => 'custom-value',
        'Authorization' => 'Bearer {token}'  # This allows you to authenticate PDFShift to your service in a custom way
    }
}

# Create a Faraday connection
conn = Faraday.new(url: "https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf") do |faraday|
    faraday.request :url_encoded
    faraday.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
end

# Make the POST request
response = conn.post do |req|
    req.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    req.headers['X-API-Key'] = api_key
    req.body = params.to_json
end

# Check for successful response
unless response.success?
    raise "Request failed with status code #{response.status}: #{response.body}"
end

# write response to a file nammed "result.pdf"
File.open('result.pdf', 'wb') { |f| f.write(response.body) }

# Print a success message
puts 'The PDF document was generated and saved to result.pdf'
```

This allows you to set specific HTTP headers that will be send along with the request PDFShift will make to your server.
It can be helpful to authenticate the request that your backend can check against before converting it to PDF.
