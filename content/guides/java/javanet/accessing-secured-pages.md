In this guide, we'll show you how to access secured page (protected by basic authentication) using Java and the Java.net library to convert them to PDF using PDFShift's API.

When you're converting a document, you might want to access a secured page (protected by basic authentication) to convert it to PDF. This can be done by setting the `auth` parameter to the request.

```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

// You can get an API key at https://pdfshift.io
String apiKey = "sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx";

URL url = new URL("https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf");
HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
connection.setRequestMethod("POST");
connection.setRequestProperty("X-API-Key", apiKey);
connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json");
connection.setDoOutput(true);

String payload = "{\n" +
    "  \"source\": \"https://www.example.com\",\n" +
    "  \"auth\": {\n" +
    "    \"username\": \"user\",\n" +
    "    \"password\": \"password\"\n" +
    "  }\n" +
    "}";

try (OutputStream os = connection.getOutputStream()) {
    byte[] input = payload.getBytes("utf-8");
    os.write(input, 0, input.length);
}

int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();

// Handle errors:
if (responseCode >= 400) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Request failed with status code " + responseCode);
}

InputStream inputStream = connection.getInputStream();
FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("result.pdf");
byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
int bytesRead;
while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
    outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
}
outputStream.close();
inputStream.close();

System.out.println("The PDF document was generated and saved to result.pdf");
```

This allows you to protect your documents from any visitors while allowing PDFShift to access the page and convert it to PDF.
