In this guide, we'll show you how to access secured page (protected by basic authentication) using Java and the OkHTTP library to convert them to PDF using PDFShift's API.

When you're converting a document, you might want to access a secured page (protected by basic authentication) to convert it to PDF. This can be done by setting the `auth` parameter to the request.

```java
import okhttp3.*;
import java.io.IOException;

// You can get an API key at https://pdfshift.io
String apiKey = "sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx";

OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(
    "{\n" +
    "  \"source\": \"https://www.example.com\",\n" +
    "  \"auth\": {\n" +
    "    \"username\": \"user\",\n" +
    "    \"password\": \"password\"\n" +
    "  }\n" +
    "}", MediaType.parse("application/json"));

Request request = new Request.Builder()
    .url("https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf")
    .addHeader("X-API-Key", apiKey)
    .post(body)
    .build();

try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
    
    // Handle errors:
    if (!response.isSuccessful()) {
        throw new IOException("Request failed with status code " + response.code());
    }
    
    ResponseBody responseBody = response.body();
    if (responseBody != null) {
        java.nio.file.Files.write(
            java.nio.file.Paths.get("result.pdf"), 
            responseBody.bytes()
        );
    }
    
    System.out.println("The PDF document was generated and saved to result.pdf");
}
```

This allows you to protect your documents from any visitors while allowing PDFShift to access the page and convert it to PDF.
