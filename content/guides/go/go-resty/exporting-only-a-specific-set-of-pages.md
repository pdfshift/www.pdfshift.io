In this guide, we'll show you how to export only a specific set of pages from a document using Go and the Go-Resty library to convert them to PDF using PDFShift's API.

When you're converting a document, you might want to export only a specific set of pages from a document. This can be done by setting the `pages` parameter to the request.

It behaves exactly like the page parameter you can see when you print a document from your browser.

It accepts the following pattern:

 * A number, such as `2`. This will print the page 2
 * A range, such as `2-4`. This will print the pages 2 to 4 (2, 3 and 4)
 * A list, such as `2,4,5,9`. This will print the pages 2, 4, 5 and 9


This way, you can only export the pages that you really need and get immediately the result you want in the PDF, without having to edit it.

Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"github.com/go-resty/resty/v2"
)

func main() {
	// You can get an API key at https://pdfshift.io
	apiKey := "sk_xxxxxxxxxxxx"

	params := map[string]interface{}{
		"source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF",
		"pages":  "2-4",
	}

	// Marshal the parameters into JSON
	jsonParams, err := json.Marshal(params)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error marshaling JSON:", err)
		return
	}
	// Create a new Resty client
	client := resty.New()

	// Perform the request
	resp, err := client.R().
		SetHeader("Content-Type", "application/json").
		SetHeader("X-API-Key", apiKey).
		SetBody(jsonParams).
		Post("https://api.pdfshift.io/v3/convert/pdf")

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error performing request:", err)
		return
	}

	// Check response status code
	if resp.StatusCode() >= 400 {
		fmt.Printf("Request failed with status code %d: %s\n", resp.StatusCode(), string(resp.Body()))
		return
	}

	// Save the PDF document
	err = ioutil.WriteFile("result.pdf", resp.Body(), 0644)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error saving PDF document:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("The PDF document was generated and saved to result.pdf")
}
```
