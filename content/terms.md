## 1. Privacy & Security; Disclosure

Our Privacy Policy, which may be viewed at [https://pdfshift.io/privacy](https://pdfshift.io/privacy), describes how we use and share Personal Information (as such term is defined in the Privacy Policy), including any payment account information you may provide to us either for purposes of creating an Account, submitting an inquiry or to receive further information, updates and promotions about or related to the Service.

It is your responsibility to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws and to ensure that you have provided all required notices and obtained all necessary consents from your Users and clients (including with respect to third parties’ access), and that your clients have agreed to the collection of their Customer Data and the access of their Customer Data by you, by us, and, where applicable, other third parties. Any sample documentation that is provided by PDFShift.io for obtaining consent is for illustration only, and you alone (and not PDFShift.io) are responsible to ensure that such documentation is adequate and enforceable to obtain requisite consent (including with respect to clients who are under 18 years of age, consent from their parents or legal guardians). In the event that we receive a subpoena or other legal or court order compelling the disclosure of any of your clients’ Customer Data or any of your data, unless ordered to not do so by a court of competent jurisdiction, or unless our legal counsel advises us that prior notification is not required or in violation of applicable law, we will notify you of the subpoena or other legal or court order prior to disclosing the Customer Data or other data. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the Service in a manner that includes appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of Customer Data that is in our possession, as required by applicable law.

PDFShift.io reserves the right to modify its privacy policy in its reasonable discretion from time to time. Note that because the Service is a hosted, online application, PDFShift.io occasionally may need to notify all users of the Service of important announcements regarding the operation of the Service.

You agree not to hold PDFShift.io liable for the Content, actions, or inactions of you or other Users of the Service or of other third parties. As a condition of access to the Service, you release PDFShift.io (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more other users of the Service or with other third parties, including whether or not PDFShift.io becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute. If you are a resident of the State of California, U.S.A., you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

## 23. Assignment; Change in Control

This Agreement may not be assigned by you without the prior written approval of PDFShift.io but may be assigned without your consent by PDFShift.io to (i) a parent or subsidiary, (ii) an acquirer of assets, or (iii) a successor by merger. Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void.

## 24. Dispute Resolution

In the event of a Dispute between you and PDFShift.io (including any dispute over the validity, enforceability, or scope of this dispute resolution provision), other than with respect to claims for injunctive relief, the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. The place of the arbitration shall be in Paris, France. In the event that there is any Dispute between you and PDFShift.io that is determined not to be subject to arbitration pursuant to the preceding sentence, you agree to submit in that event to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of France located in Paris. You agree that this Agreement and the relationship between you and PDFShift.io shall be governed by the laws of France without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. Notwithstanding this, either party shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce that party’s Intellectual Property Rights in any court of competent jurisdiction where the other party resides or has its principal place of business.

## 25. Class Action Waiver

Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, consolidation of your Dispute with other arbitrations, or any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity or as a private attorney general are not permitted and are waived by you, and an arbitrator will have no jurisdiction to hear such claims. If a court or arbitrator finds that the class action waiver in this section is unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then the class action waiver will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this Dispute resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of this section remaining in full force and effect.
