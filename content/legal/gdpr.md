<p class="excerpt">Everything you need to know about PDFShift's GDPR compliance.</p>

PDFShift is committed to privacy, security, compliance and transparency. This approach includes supporting our customers’ compliance with EU data protection requirements, including those set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018.


## What is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is a regulation by which the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission intend to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union (EU).


## To Whom Does the GDPR Apply?

One way in which the personal data of an EU citizen could be collected when using PDFShift is when you build a database of contacts, their information, and business dealings with them (i.e. a CRM system).  
Not all customers will be "data subjects", as data subjects are only individuals. Some of your customers may be businesses or government organizations, which the GDPR does not apply to.


## Is PDFShift GDPR compliant?

Yes, PDFShift is compliant with the GDPR.
