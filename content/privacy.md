## WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS

The PDFShift Service is not intended for use by persons under the age of 18. If PDFShift has reason to believe that a user is under the age of 18, PDFShift will promptly block and/or terminate that user’s account and delete all personal information previously submitted by that user, with or without notice to the user or his or her parents or guardians.

If PDFShift learns that it has collected personal data from a person under the age of 18, it will delete that information as quickly as possible.

For your convenience, hyperlinks may be posted on the PDFShift websites or apps that link to other websites or apps that PDFShift does not own or control. This privacy policy is not applicable to them and PDFShift has no liability for the content of third-party websites nor the personal data they collect.

## WHAT PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED AND PROCESSED BY PDFSHIFT

## INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

When accessing a PDFShift website or app, please note that through your continued use of it, if you are located in a different country than the PDFShift website or app, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to a country outside of your own.
